      What you found here is a set of simple dictionaries that aim at covering:
      <ul><li> all markup-driven configuration</li><li>all public methods</li><li><em>in the future: avaliable CSS classes</em></li> </ul>
      All content was fetched automatically from library files and jquerymobile.com (both docs and source HTML) and is avaliable as this simple dictionary so that you don't have to look for it all through the docs. I am still working on it.

      Hey, if you want to contribute to this dictionary or add items to FAQ you can <strong>e-mail me</strong> - I'm naugtur and I use gmail [take that, spambots! ;)]
      </p><p>The dictionary is missing <code>info</code>s. I proposed adding them on github, but there was no response, so I'll be working on a new cooperation idea. 
      </p> <p>
      You can send me tips and your versions of info.json. Every work will be appreciated. :)
